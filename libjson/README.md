# build2-libjson
Packaging of Json for Modern C++ library to work with build2  [nlohmann](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)

## Disclamer
This repository does not contain my work it is purely there so that I can use the repository mentioned in the previous section with a project that uses [build2](https://build2.org/). All of the credit for the content of this repository are due to the original author of this nice Json library.
